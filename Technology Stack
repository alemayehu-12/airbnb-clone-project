## Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project uses a modern technology stack designed to support scalable, secure, and efficient web application development.

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework that simplifies backend development and helps build RESTful APIs quickly and securely.

- **MySQL:** A powerful relational database system used to store and manage structured data such as users, bookings, properties, and reviews.

- **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs that enables the frontend to request exactly the data it needs, improving performance and reducing over-fetching.

- **Docker:** A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.

- **GitHub Actions:** A continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tool used to automate testing and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.

- **Markdown:** A lightweight markup language used to create clean and readable documentation (like this README.md) for developers and stakeholders.
